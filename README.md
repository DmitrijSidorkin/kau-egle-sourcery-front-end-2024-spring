## How to setup and run the project

### Prerequisites

##### NVM

First, make sure that you have NVM installed on your machine, guidelines on how to do that and the documentation can be found here

**Linux**

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

**Windows**

https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

Once that is done, install the node version specified in the `.nvmrc` file. You can do that by running `nvm install version` in the root directory. Then go run the command `nvm use` to use Node version declared in the `.nvmrc` file.

If the error `Invalid version` is received, enter the node version specified in the `.nvmrc` file manually: `nvm use version`.

You can install all the required dependencies by running the `npm i` command in the root directory. If everything is alright, dependencies for the app will be installed.

To run the applications in development mode, run these commands in terminal:

`npm run dev` - to run the development server, launches on `localhost` on port `3000`.
